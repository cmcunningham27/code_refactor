# Code Refactor

## About the Project

&nbsp;

#### The Horiseon Marketing Agency is providing this website to help business owners understand different strategies they can utilize to increase their marketing abilities.

&nbsp;

#### Horiseon wanted their codebase to follow accessibility standards in order to make their own website optimized for search engines.

&nbsp;

#### To accomplish this I added alt attributes to images and internal links, provided semantic structures, condensed the CSS selectors, and made sure all links worked accordingly.
