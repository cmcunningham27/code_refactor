# Code Refactor

## About the Project
---
#### The Horiseon Marketing Agency is providing this website to help business owners understand different strategies they can utilize to increase their marketing abilities.


#### Horiseon wanted their codebase to follow accessibility standards in order to make their own website optimized for search engines.

#### To accomplish their needs/wants I added alt attributes to images and internal links, provided semantic structures, condensed the CSS selectors, and made sure all links worked accordingly.
